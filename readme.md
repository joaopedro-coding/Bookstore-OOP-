# 🛒 Shopping Cart System (Python)

This project is a basic command-line shopping cart system built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to add, remove, list, and calculate the total cost of products in a cart. The program is structured using classes to simulate a simple e-commerce experience.

## 🚀 Features

- Add a product to the cart with name, price, and quantity
- Remove a product from the cart
- List all products currently in the cart
- Calculate the total cost of the cart
- Empty the cart completely
- Console-based interaction menu
- User based system
- Discount system

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Below are some planned enhancements to the project:

### ✅ Feature Ideas

1. **Product Search & Filtering**
   - Search for a product by name or part of its name
   - Filter products by price range or category (if implemented)

2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - Optional: Create a GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` for a more user-friendly experience

3. **Implement rating**
   - Create a system to let the user rate the books he read.

4. **Let a user borrow a book to another user**
   - Create a system that let's an user borrow a book to the other. And a due date to return or else a tax will be deducted from the borrower.
