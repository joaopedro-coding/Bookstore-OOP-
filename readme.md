# 🛒 Shopping Cart System (Python)

This project is a basic command-line shopping cart system built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to add, remove, list, and calculate the total cost of products in a cart. The program is structured using classes to simulate a simple e-commerce experience.

## 🚀 Features

- Add a product to the cart with name, price, and quantity
- Remove a product from the cart
- List all products currently in the cart
- Calculate the total cost of the cart
- Empty the cart completely
- Console-based interaction menu

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Below are some planned enhancements to the project:

### ✅ Feature Ideas

1. **User System**
   - Create a `User` class with:
     - Name
     - Wallet (balance)
     - List of purchased products
     - Method to check if the user has enough money to purchase an item
     - Method to perform a purchase and deduct from wallet

2. **Discount Coupons**
   - Add support for discount codes that can reduce the total value of the cart

3. **Product Search & Filtering**
   - Search for a product by name or part of its name
   - Filter products by price range or category (if implemented)

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - Optional: Create a GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` for a more user-friendly experience
